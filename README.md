# Who Evaluates the Evaluator - a survey of  word embedding evaluation methods
This [survey paper](WhoEvaluatesTheEvaluator_ProjectWork_SStanisic_800409.pdf) explores the challenges in evaluating word embeddings, emphasizing that no single model is universally optimal for all tasks. It discusses intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods, highlighting how phonosemantic analysis, which connects linguistic form with meaning, can offer insights into word semantics. The paper reviews extensive experiments comparing various embedding models (such as SGNS, CBOW, GloVe, FastText, ngram2vec, and Dic2vec) across different tasks. The findings suggest that model performance is highly dependent on the task at hand, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for word embedding evaluation.
